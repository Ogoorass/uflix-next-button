# uflix-next-button
Browser extension, that adds a button under the meida player to move to the next episode of some series. It also works on the mobile phone browser.

## Firefox
[Here](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/uflix-next-button/) is a link, where you can download this add-on. It is official Firefox extension browser. This add-on is vierified by Mozilla. 
You can also add this extension manually as debug, but it will have only temporary status. It will disapear after restart, I think. The link is better.

## Chrome, Opera and ohter browsers, I guess
If you are using other browsers you can download from releases the latest version archive that is named `uflix-next-button-chrome.zip`, unpack it and add it to your browser via extension module.
